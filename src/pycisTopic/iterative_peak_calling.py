    Returns consensus peaks from a set of MACS narrow peak results. First, each summit is extended a `peak_half_width` in each direction

    be merged and depending on the number of peaks included into them, different processes will happen:
    * **1 peak**:  The original peak region will be kept
    * **2 peaks**:  The original peak region with the highest score will be kept

    this merged peak region that overlap with the significant peak region will be removed. The process is repeated with the next most
    significant peak (if it was not removed already) until all peaks are processed.

    This proccess will happen twice, first in each pseudobulk peaks; and after peak score normalization, to process all peaks together.

    Parameters
    ---------
    narrow_peaks_dict: dict

            Number of base pairs that each summit will be extended in each direction.
    chromsizes: pd.PyRanges or pd.DataFrame
            A data frame or :class:`pr.PyRanges` containing size of each column, containing 'Chromosome', 'Start' and 'End' columns.
    path_to_blacklist: str, optional
            Path to bed file containing blacklist regions (Amemiya et al., 2019). Default: None

    Return
    ------
    pr.PyRanges
            A pyRanges containing chromosome, start and end coordinates and the peaks ids of the original peaks that are contained in the
            consensus region.
